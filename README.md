## Milestone

Milestone is a simple syntax definition for defining lists of tasks.
When your working on a project, it can come in handy to track the list of things that you have to do and mark then as `not pending`, `in progress` or `done`.

### Status

* Pending `'...'` 
* In progress `"..."` 
* Done ``
